This movie is horrible.
This movie is great.
This movie is scary.
This movie is poetic.
This movie is bad.
This movie is meh.
This movie is bad in a good way.
This movie is good.
I wasted my time and my money on this film.
I love my phone.
The acting was great, dialogue was clever, story was brilliant, but the film overall sucked.
That's my favourite song!
This book is exciting.
The thoughtful tv show will have a new episode next week and I can't wait.
